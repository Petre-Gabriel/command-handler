# General Command Handler

A generic command handler for platforms like Rage:MP / Alt:V. It contains a basic handler with support for flags validation ( for permissions ) and syntax validation with custom messages.

Everything you need to get started is located in the `src` folder. You can modify it's configuration in the `src/config.ts`.

## How to get started

If you want to incorporate the handler in your project, you will need to replace the user placeholder with the platform specific type. The user placeholder is used only in the `src/lib/handler.ts` file.
